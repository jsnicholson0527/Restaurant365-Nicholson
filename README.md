This is the repository in response to the Calculator Code Challenge

As discussed during my initial screening interview, I have not developed code since 2002
My career path has led me down a primarily technical management path and while I have led developers, designed solutions and participated in architectural designs and decisions;
I have not actively participated in the hands-on development of solutions in some time.

With this in mind, I took a different approach to this challenge. 
Given my experience level and the proposed scope of this position, I took a management/leadership perspective to solving this challenge.

Specifically:
1. I created a GitHub account and learned the interface (In my current job we use Bitbucket)
2. I chose a language that is currently in use at my current company (JavaScript)
3. Instead of being able to engage a developer on my team to address this feature, I utilized AI (askaichat.ai)
4. I fed the requirements into the UI
5. Had AI generate the code
6. Had AI generate the corresponding Unit Tests
7. Reviewed the code and tests provided
8. Executed the Commit
9. Repeated steps 4-8 for each requirement, to reflect changing requirements
10. Reflected the requirement as detailed comments in the commit
11. As a peer review, I reran the combined requirements through AI as a single prompt and looked for appreciable differences between the two
