This is the repository in response to the Calculator Code Challenge

As discussed during my initial screening interview, I have not developed code since 2002
My career path as led me down a primarily technical management path and while I have led developers, designed solutions and participated in architectural designs and decisions;
I have not actively participated in the hands-on development of solutions.

With this in mind, I took a different approach to this challenge. 
Given my experience level and the proposed scope of this position, I took a management/leadership perspective to solving this challenge.

Specifically:
1. I created a GitHub account and learned the interface (In my current job we use Bitbucket)
2. I chose a language that is currently in use at my current company (JavaScript)
3. Instead of being able to engage a developer on my team to address this feature, I utilized AI (askaichat.ai)
   a.  I the requirement into the UI
   b.  Executied the commit
   c.  Reviewed the code provided 
   d.  Reran the requirement through AI to see if the solution was different to act as a peer review
   e.  Followed the the above steps for each requirement, to reflect changing requirements
